Here, I will show how we can use MLFlow to try different Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision Tree or Logisitic Regression with a trivial dataset : Iris.
The point is to put forward the benefices of MLFlow. For example, the comparaison of metrics between different hyperparameters of the same (or not) ML algorithm.

Next, I'll make a notebook to show how can we deploy, manage and follow our ML model.
